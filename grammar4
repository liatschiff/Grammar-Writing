# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
#
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars, you should
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.
#
#    - But the  *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can the program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#    S  = sentence
#    SBAR = Subordinate clause
#    NP = noun phrase
#    Nnp = proper noun
#    Prp = Personal pronoun
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    ADJP = adjective phrase
#    Adj = adjectivethat starts with consonant
#    VowAdj = adjective that starts with vowel
#    Noun = noun that starts with consonant
#    Noun = noun that starts with vowel
#    ADVP = adverb phrase
#    Rb = adverb
#    Vbg = Verb gerund or present participle
#    Vbd = verb,past form
#    Vbz = verb, 3rd person singular present
#    Cconj = conjunctions (coordination rule template)
#    Sconj = subordinating conjunction (a subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other.)
#    AUX = auxiliary
#    Vp_intran = Intransitive verb present form
#    Vp_trans = Transitive verb present form



# To create these rules we were helped by spaCy library and Stanford algo (link: corenlp.run), as Reut recommended.
