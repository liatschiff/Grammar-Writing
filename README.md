# Grammar-Writing
Second Assignment in 'NLP - Natural Languages Processing' course by Prof. Yoav Goldberg, Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty at Bar-Ilan University.

Goal: Understanding how Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) work, and how they can be used - sometimes comfortably, sometimes not so much - to describe natural language. It also made me think about some linguistic phenomena that are interesting in their own right.

The assignment consists of the following parts:

Part 0 - Generating Sentences from a CFG
Part 1 - Weights
Part 2 - Extending the Grammar
Part 3 - Tree Structures
Part 4 - Additional Linguistic Structures
Part 5 - Extra

Score: 100
